- Builtins:
  - Printing any object to terminal (best effort)
  - Printing concrete string to terminal

- Compilation:
  - more erasure in Zonk: pass/compute type, immediately erase things with U/Unit type

- Elaboration
  - definitional monad laws
  - more Code unification
  - (record unification)
